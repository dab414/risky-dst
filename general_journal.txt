  think im most of the way there
  cgi script is failing (of course) and need to confirm that sona credits are being passed appropriately


10-25-2021
  now replicating e3 of the original dissertation study on the subject pool to ensure that the rounding confound doesn't impact the results
    i have a sinking feeling that it won't replicate regardless......

  need to be mindful of passing the sona id as a param throughout the exp, needs to be handed back to sona with name 'id'
    https://www.sona-systems.com/help/qualtrics_chaining.aspx

  how to handle ppl who are spamming
    i think im content to just shut them down with a screen that says they can contact me if they want another shot
    but not actually do anything programatically that will prevent them from just doing it again

  dont forget to put the sona link under the reject consent button

  alright, i think ive updated everything through cued prac
    obviously still needs a lot of checking and testing

8/6/2019
  pilot is released
  i started building exp 3 for production
  ill obv need to go through the details of this a lot
  make sure all links are right, etc

8/5/2019
	im noticing that there must be subtle rounding differences in the units presentation
	sometimes they're off by like one unit

8/2/2019
  things to do to get exp 3 going:
    finish tweaking the pilot
      functionally, it's pretty much there
      i just need to decide on exact stimuli and then do instructions
      idk if i like the word 'decrease' being associated with what should be represented as gains

      only once all this ^ is good can i do the instructional vid

      finalize the questions i wanna ask in the survey

    finish the power analysis
      should be simple if im just simulating from the model that's fit to exp 2 data

  then eventually prepare the report for the committee

	back-to-back crises in two days
	yesterday was attack of the bots
	today boto stops being supported 
	jesus christ
	successfully migrated to boto3 (i think)
	it's mostly the same.. just some differences with syntax
	i think ive disabled all the automated stuff that manipulates boto
	i was doing most of that stuff by hand anyway

	i got freaked out bc i thought the IsOnTurk() function was broken
		but it's not
		whew

	alright, we gon be good

  wooo so i forgot to include qualifications so i had to terminate the hits early
  a total of five subjects were collected, data from all looks good, all were accepted
  will release a batch with qualifications tomorrow

  **
  need to revamp exp1RejectBots.py script

7/11/2019
  to-do list:
    kill console logging
      done
    add warning about accuracy-based hit rejection
      done
    save out response key
      done
    in cued intersperse version, add in more instructions 
      done
    post exps in sandbox with high max assignments
      done
    revise pilot recruit and host on website as html
      done
    figure out some type of protocol for easily changing between development / production thresholds
      done

  REMEMBER TO REENABLE THE UNIQUE WORKER SCRIPT BEFORE LAUNCHING!!
      

7/10/2019
  thresholds
    prac cued (for exps 1 and 2): 160 trials
    dst
      exp1
        100 trials per block (4 blocks per cycle)
        4 cycles
      exp2
        17 trials per choice, 4 choices per cycle
        17 cycles (from trial threshold calculations)

  remember to kill all console logging
  add some type of warning about accuracy-based hit rejection

7/8/2019
  almost completely ready to go
  added microbatching script
    i don't think it should be too bad managing all that
  managing unique workers
    look here: http://uniqueturker.myleott.com/
      to constrain to only unique workers to one *batch* of hits
    what defines a batch?
      i think it's all of one particular *HitType*
        create a meta HitType: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITTypeOperation.html
        create a HIT of a particular, pre-existing HITType: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITWithHITTypeOperation.html
    it might be to my advantage to just keep everything as one batch though
      analogous to running two experiments under one ID in sona

  misc
    look into why full screen button doesn't appear on video controls
    can prob start building up a library of MTurkConnection helper functions
    save out response key to data

6/13/2019
  im just adding in the deck background image for now
  then when dad leaves ill do the video

6/12/2019
  so this is pretty much ready to go
  just need to basically copy and paste the demo routine in, but the dst stimulus presentation and data collection seems flawless..
  i also need to make the instructional video
    it's actually essential to the manipulation now that Ps watch the video
    i might wanna think about how to make advancing to the exp contingent on having finished the video..

6/11/2019
  first time returning since 'the incident'
  i need to do a lot of refreshing on wtf is going on here
  the existing exp1 slot needs to be migrated to garbage...
  then ill develop in that directory

  got up through the block-level procedure of the dst
    need to really look through that again after i've eaten
    i think it looks good, but the conditional logic gets tricky...

4/1/2019
  things left to do:
    transcribe instructions
    set thresholds
    make some indication about introducing S as a decision key in the last phase
    i only wrote in runtime for the first phase
    watch: if you skip right to twoChoice, the high-demand points is NaN
      might want to program in a default here in case calibration fails for any reason

3/31/2019
  things left to do:
    instructions
    figure out how to run online with pypool
    remove all console logs
    figure out whether i can get a static and reliable link to the HIT
  https://www.nchsoftware.com/capture/index.html
    screen capturing

3/27/2019
  i *think* three choice is working well
  my only concern is, for the neutral trials, there's very little attribute space on the switching dimension
  i've noticed several times the p(switch | neutral) = p(switch | hardTask), which i don't like
  but fr i think we're at a point where things are really working

3/14/2019
  alright, can't put this off anymore
  time to really think hard about how im gonna program all these
  exp1 is the most important to get off the ground rn... but i ought to think whether i can consolidate some of the programming efforts across all three exps

  things like certain html pages or css might pretty easily transfer across exps.. i think that's easy enough to copy & paste tho..
  so maybe the idea will be to, while programming exp1, think about how i can abstract certain operations across all experiments, then build up a library that i can source from throughout

  put together a basic opening slide 
  still need to do key remind and stimulus slide [for cued practice, to start]
